## Talks

### Petro Silenius: Reviewing code – live

Code review is a practice (hopefully) in all of our daily work. It helps us create quality software and develop our skills. But how does one produce a quality code review? We’ll take a look at some prerequisites and tips for code review. The highlight of the talk will be a code review done live together with the audience

### Teemu Suoranta: The Art of Work Estimation

Making time estimates is part of developers’ day to day tasks. Unfortunately the whole business of work estimation is inherently broken in many ways that cannot be fixed. Navigating risks, fuzzy scopes and missing specifications is less of a science and more of an art to be mastered.

As a senior developer, I have been a key part of creating many quotes along the years and I will share the mistakes and insights from my journey. I cannot fix the work estimation but I can help you avoid a few pitfalls and give you better tools. Estimation work has been sort of taboo in the developer community and it is time to break the silence.
